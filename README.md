This project aims to provide data-driven solutions to address financial challenges faced by a vegetable retail business, Raj Kishore Kumar Gupta and Sons. The primary objectives are to optimize pricing strategies, enhance profitability, and implement structured credit management practices.

## Project Overview

- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of transactional data spanning 31 days, including cost prices, selling prices, quantities, and credit transactions.
- Employed time-series analysis, statistical computations, and regression modeling to determine ideal pricing margins.
- Developed a structured credit management system by analyzing creditor data, identifying patterns, and recommending criteria for credit allocation.

## Data Collection

The project involved the collection of two types of data:

1. **Vegetable Transaction Data**: This dataset includes details such as vegetable names, cost prices, selling prices, and quantities sold.
